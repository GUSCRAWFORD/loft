# Write less code, manage workspace clutter

Loft is a tool you can use anywhere to take a snapshot of code and re-scaffold to another folder.

You can copy work from anywhere, annotate the file with variables and re-generate your code ad-hoc for a new purpose.

### loft

**noun**
1. a room or space directly under the roof of a house or other building, which maybe used for accomodations or storage.
2. kick, hit, or throw (a ball or missile, *or code*) high up.
   - *"he lofted the code out of his badly trashed home-directory*"

## When and why?

- You have a lot of boiler-plate code outside of, or no longer manageable by another tooling framework.
- You have local code that you don't want to publicize or gist, don't want to lose, but want out of your home directory.
- You're doing something replicable, it's not ready to be (or there is no time to) isolated into a separate block, and you want to be able to extract and re-test it quickly, later on.

## Why not...

- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) Yeoman is a mature, extensible scaffolder with a deep library of seed generators; Yeoman is my-man (punny), **but** I don't always need a code-generator nor am I bound within it's guiderails in many cases.
- I may simply need to repurpose something already generated and improved before in another project, or I may be in some kind of transitive state toward developing my own generator!
    - Loft like Yeoman, is *language agnostic*
    - Yeoman is *opiniated* by it's own concession, while Loft is **not opinionated**; it's focus is to further ignore workflow, frameworks, environment, etc. and just template files.

## Install

`yarn global add @guscrawford.com/loft-interface`

## Create a Scaffold

Copy work anywhere to a folder in your home directory (`$HOME|$USERPROFILE/.loft/scaffolds`)


`loft [<new> scaffold <my-snippet-name>] [path-to-snippet]`

*example:*

`loft new scaffold my-code ./src`

## Use a Scaffold

Copy work from your scaffolds into anywhere you're working.

`loft <new> [workspace] my-snippet <target-directory>`

*example:*

`loft new my-code my-cloned-code`

### Annotate your Code with Variables & Replace Them

You can prep (or edit already stored code `$HOME|$USERPROFILE/.loft/scaffolds`) your code with commented annoations in any script language that has a way to comment.  (JSON files are not thought of yet ðŸ˜… and could be scaffolded, although awkwardly).

*example:*

Presuming I already have a scaffold named `any-command` with this file in it commented as so:

```
//@loft:XXX
export class AnyXXXCommand extends LoftCommand{
    constructor (args) {
        super(args);
    }
    //@loft:xxx
    name = "xxx";
    async loadScaffolds() {
        await LoftToolkit.ensure(LOFT_PATH);
        return new Promise(
            function (res, rej){
                ...
            }
        );
    }
}
```

Running: `loft new any-command help-command XXX Helpfile:xxx help`

Will rename files matching the `file:` arguments to their supplied parameter, and replace file contents matching the `@loft:` variable prefix against the paramater pairs supplied in the `XXX` example.

*example output:*

```
//@loft:XXX
export class AnyHelpCommand extends LoftCommand{
    constructor (args) {
        super(args);
    }
    //@loft:xxx
    name = "help";
    async loadScaffolds() {
        await LoftToolkit.ensure(LOFT_PATH);
        return new Promise(
            function (res, rej){
                ...
            }
        );
    }
}
```

### Complete Annotation List

`@loft:<variable>` - defines or 'scopes' a *variable* in the code for replacing; could be part of a variable, the whole thing, it currently can be any non-whitespace character to leave things open for further pattern matching, but for now is reccomended you use a variable name that will not break your code from running, un-annotated.

Scoping is good on a per-file basis.  Matching filenames is currently at a whole-project scope and has no variable syntax beyond specifying a simple pattern to match on the command line with the `file:` prefixed argument.

`@deloft:<variable>` - removes or 'descopes' a *variable* in the code from any further replacing;
